Introduction to the Snake Game

This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It provides a simple yet engaging interactive experience where the player controls a snake, 
navigating it to eat food, grow in length, and accumulate points.

Key Features:

Gameplay Mechanics: The core gameplay involves using arrow keys (or on-screen controls for mobile) 
		    to direct the snake within a defined grid. The snake grows longer each time 
                    it consumes food (represented by a yellow circle). 
                    The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game board or 
                    its own body.
Scoring System: The game tracks the player's score, increasing it each time the snake eats food. 
                It also maintains a high score, saved locally in the browser, providing a persistent 
                record of the player's best performance. A "Reset Score" button allows the player 
                to reset the high score.
User Interface: The game features a clean and intuitive user interface. An information box provides 
                instructions to the player, and the game board clearly displays the snake and food. 
                The score and high score are prominently displayed. A "Game Over" message is displayed 
                when the player loses.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout to different
                   screen sizes. On smaller screens, the information box and game elements 
                   are rearranged for optimal viewing and playability.
Controls: The game supports both keyboard arrow key input and on-screen touch controls for direction. 
          It also includes a restart functionality triggered by pressing the 'R' key or 
          the space bar after the game over.

Technical Highlights:
HTML Structure: The HTML file (index.html) sets up the basic structure of the game, 
		including the game board (.play-board), score display (.game-details), 
		control buttons (.controls), and information box (.info-box). It also includes 
		a div element to display the "Game Over" message.
CSS Styling: The CSS file (style.css) handles the visual presentation of the game. 
	     It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness of the elements. 
	     Flexbox and Grid layout are used for positioning elements.
JavaScript Logic: The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the game's logic. 
	     It manages the snake's movement, food generation, collision detection, 
	     score updates, and game state. It uses setInterval for the game loop and 
	     DOM manipulation to update the display. Local storage is used to persist the high score.


In summary, this Snake game project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, combining HTML 
for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and game logic. It's a well-structured 
example of a browser-based game.
